God above all! I am a first-generation college graduate. I am a Software Engineer with a background in Computer Engineering Technology from The New York City College of Technology. I have interned at NASA 2 times. In my second internship, I assisted in analyzing the data for Hall thrusters in the Electrical Propulsion Laboratory. This will contribute to the Advanced Electric Propulsion System on the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) for NASAâ€™s Gateway. I developed a weather application and here is my awesome work, this is the link https://pratimaroyweatherapp.netlify.app/.

:hibiscus:Fun Fact: I love Studio Ghibli films and I also got viral for being me!
